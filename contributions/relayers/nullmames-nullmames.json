   "additionalComments": "For this challenge i have thoroughly documented the use of hermes for relaying to kichain-t-4. The documentation is formatted, easy to read and was written in such a way that most anyone should be able to recreate the relayer for them selves. I have also created another seto of documentation using raw transactions to create the channels, although this was discontinued once it was discovered that IBC was not enabled on kichain-t-3 https://gist.github.com/nullmames/00d40ed9c015a2588bae55a57598af7e"
