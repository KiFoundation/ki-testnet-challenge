# Ki Testnet Challenge
This repository hosts `ki-testnet-challenge`. A set of scripts and resources to be used for the Ki Testnet Challenge

## What is the testnet challenge
The Testnet Challenge consists of a series of more or less technical tasks related to the validator operator role on the KiChain. During the course of the challenge, the tasks get progressively more difficult, they range from “do it whenever/however you want” tasks to “be ready to spend few hours on this one” tasks.
